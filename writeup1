# Step - 1 Found IP machine

As part of the Boot2Root, we were required to identify the IP address of the target virtual machine without any direct access to it. The discovery had to be performed exclusively from the host machine.

### Network Configuration

The virtual machine was configured using Host-only networking in VirtualBox, with the vboxnet0 interface.
This setup allows communication between the host and the VM while keeping the target isolated from the external network.

###  Methodology

After verifying that the Host-only network was properly configured on the host, we performed a network discovery scan to identify active hosts on the subnet:

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24
```

The scan revealed two active hosts:

```bash
$ sben-tay% nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24

Host is up (0.0013s latency).
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 2.91 seconds
```
### Conclusion

We successfully identified the IP address of the Boot2Root virtual machine without internal access, using only host-based network reconnaissance.

Target VM IP address:

``192.168.56.101``
